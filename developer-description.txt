Dear reviewr

There is some neccesery points to be mentioned:

1- I saw in my task question you mentioned that I am not allowd to use any premade css framework. You didn't speak about
javascript frameworks or libraries. So I prefered to write pure javascript. However I know that I could use some libraries
like jQuery to manage DOM easier, requierJs to have dependency injection, or even modern javascript frameworks like angular 8
to have all this features and more.

2- Using semantic Html5 markups was important in my task. I know this approach, but this page has a simple html and I used just
"head", "main" and "date" tags.

3- All graphical symbols in this page (delet icon, search icon, location icon and animated loader) are created with just css and
I haven't used any image, icon or font-icon.

4- I have extended the task to be a bit more intresting :)))).

5- Both public APIs which I used are free and limited and return only 5 result in each request. However I handled the overflow of 
suggestion-panel. You can ckeck it by feeding hard-code result.

All the best.
